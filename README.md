## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **optimizing pacemaker battery life** using mathematical modeling and simulation.  
Given the critical role of pacemakers in treating heart diseases, enhancing battery longevity reduces surgical risks, lowers costs, and improves patient quality of life.  

Our approach applies the **Single Particle Model (SPM)** to lithium-ion batteries, simulating electrochemical behavior and optimizing parameters like **C-rate, capacity, and discharge current** for maximum lifespan.
